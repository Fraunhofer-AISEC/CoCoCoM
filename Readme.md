Note that SEV and SEV-ES lack several required features for confidentiality and integrity protection and have several known vulnerablities. Thus, looking at AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX or Arm CCA is recommended.

## Introduction

This is a collection of scripts to live-migrate containers in encrypted virtual machines. This repository is split into four parts that address different aspects.

* The host setup ([host-setup](host-setup/Readme.md))
* The launch of an SEV-encrypted VM with secret injection for full disk encryption ([injection](injection/Readme.md)).
* The migration of an SEV-encrypted VM ([migration](migration/Readme.md))
* The VM / network setup with wireguard that allows transparent migration of containers ([VM-setup](VM-setup/Readme.md))

## Compatibility

This guide is based on the setup of an Ubuntu 20.04 server running on an EPYC Naples chip and AMD firmware version API:0.17 build:22. This guide does not cover SEV-ES or SEV-SNP, only SEV which is the first generation of AMD's technology.

Below are the versions of the main components that are used. SEV secret injection and SEV-VM migration were developped in different repositories and/or branches at the point of implementation.
